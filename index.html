      <h2>Building My Creative Base</h2>
      <p>My journey began with a Bachelor's Degree in Industrial Design at UniverCidade (2002-2006). This phase was all about building the foundation for my design expertise-exploring creativity, innovation, and strategic thinking. Early on, I worked as an Art Director at agencies like Agencia3 and Internad Publicidade, where I honed my skills in advertising campaigns and visual storytelling. These experiences shaped my artistic sensibilities and problem-solving mindset, preparing me for what was to come.</p>

      <h2>Merging Faith and Communication</h2>
      <p>When I pursued my Master’s in Theology at Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (2014–2016), I discovered how to bring my design expertise together with a deep understanding of theology and communication. As Communication Manager at Betânia Church, I had the chance to completely revamp the church's branding, improve internal processes, and engage the community in meaningful ways. It was a time when I realized how powerful communication could be in creating connections and driving impact.</p>

      <h2>Shaping a Visionary Brand</h2>
      <p>In 2019, I took a leap and founded Bejota+Design. Leading a remote team, I worked with over 40 clients, delivering tailored branding and marketing solutions. I implemented Agile methodologies and Design Thinking to drive creativity and ensure client satisfaction. Beyond design, I offered personalized brand advisory services, helping clients develop cohesive and impactful identities. This was my chance to step into entrepreneurship and create something truly meaningful.</p>

      <h2>Redefining Innovation in Canada</h2>
      <p>Today, I’m pursuing a Diploma in Interactive Design - User Experience Major at SAIT (2024–present). This phase represents a new chapter in my life as I integrate my extensive experience with cutting-edge digital innovation. As the Head of Marketing at DECO Windshield Repair, I lead initiatives to improve customer satisfaction, SEO, and brand visibility. It’s been an exciting journey, blending strategic thinking with user-centric design in a dynamic, international market.</p>
